   <p style="color:white">Me and my homies come from different backgrounds, but we all have something in common- the love for basketball. This is <a href="https://youtu.be/kKPR_fRjsy4">us</a> in a game. I couldn't play because of some sircumstances, anyways our team was one of the best if not the best team in the state of hesse Germany. We were a very multicultural team comprising of africans, americans, afghans, iranis turks, poles and germans - nontheless we all got along witheachother perfectly and had a very good chemistry. Its been 13years since we destroyed our opponents but I can't and will never forget this overwhelming time.</p>

   <p style="color:white">As you can see myteammates could play on numerous positions if not all, which made our playing style so dangerous and fustrating for our opponents.We were very athletic and full of testosterone and adrenalin.
